Pathogens in turn have coped with such barriers to gain access to nutrients and proliferate inside the plant. The “zigzag model” illustrates in a simple way the different layers of innate immunity during interactions of plants with their pathogen [1]. This model describes two main immunity responses, the first one relies on plants' ability to recognize so-called microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), which are highly conserved structures and molecules in all kinds of pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms. This response is known as MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) and is efficient against non-adapted or non-host pathogens [2]. The best-studied MAMPs are the flagelline peptide, the elongation factor Tu protein (EF-Tu), chitin whis is a major component of fungal cell walls and lipopolysacharides (LPS). MAMPs perception depends on plant pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), with FLS2 and EFR recognizing flagelline and EF-Tu, respectively. These two PRRs share a similar structural architecture formed by extracellular Leucine Rich Repeats (LRR) and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. CERK1, on the other hand, which is the Arabidopsis PRR involved in the recognition of chitine, contains three extracellular LysM domains and a cytoplasmic kinase domain.
